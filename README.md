# WPEmbedTTVClip
A tiny utility tool to convert Twitch clip URLs into code to use in Wordpress! 

I got tired of modifying Twitch's embed clip code & adding extra code so that it displays properly on my Wordpress site,<br>
so I made this tiny tool that took lots of hours to make but it does the job of making my life easier.

This is my first *published* application since learning C# in November 2022 so I am sure there is plenty of code tidbits<br>
that could be written more efficiently or something about regex BUT I DO NOT CARE. It works. I am proud of it. :tada:
